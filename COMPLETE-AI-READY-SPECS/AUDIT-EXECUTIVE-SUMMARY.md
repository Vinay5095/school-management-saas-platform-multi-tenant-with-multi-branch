## ⚠️ MINOR RECOMMENDATIONS (Non-Blocking)

### These are ENHANCEMENTS, not requirements

1. **API Rate Limiting Details** (Optional)
   - Add specific rate limits to each endpoint
   - Impact: Low - Can be set during implementation
   - **Not a blocker** ✅

2. **Error Message Catalog** (Optional)
   - Create centralized error code reference
   - Impact: Low - Errors already specified in specs
   - **Not a blocker** ✅

3. **Performance Benchmarks** (Optional)
   - Add explicit performance targets
   - Impact: Low - Can be optimized post-launch
   - **Not a blocker** ✅

**None of these prevent AI from building the platform!**
