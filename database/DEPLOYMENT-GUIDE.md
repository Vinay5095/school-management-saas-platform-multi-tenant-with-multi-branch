# üöÄ Database Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

- Access to Supabase SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yduvzuklowctiyxxbzch/sql
- Service role key configured (already in .env.local)

## üìù Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Execute Schema (Create Tables)

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `database/complete-schema.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run" button
5. **Expected result**: ~30 tables created successfully

**Verify:**
- Go to "Table Editor" tab
- You should see: tenants, branches, users, students, parents, staff, etc.

---

### Step 2: Execute RLS Policies (Security)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Fixed auth schema permission issue**

The RLS policies have been updated to use `public` schema instead of `auth` schema to avoid permission errors.

1. Stay in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `database/policies/rls-policies.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run" button
5. **Expected result**: 60+ RLS policies created successfully

**Verify:**
- Go to "Authentication" ‚Üí "Policies"
- You should see policies for each table
- Functions should be in "Database" ‚Üí "Functions" tab

---

### Step 3: Execute Functions & Triggers

1. Stay in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `database/functions/database-functions.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run" button
5. **Expected result**: 20+ functions and 12 triggers created

**Verify:**
- Go to "Database" ‚Üí "Functions"
- You should see: calculate_age, calculate_fee_balance, get_attendance_percentage, etc.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Error: "permission denied for schema auth"

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - The RLS policies file has been updated to use `public` schema instead of `auth` schema.

If you see this error:
```
ERROR: 42501: permission denied for schema auth
```

**It means you're using an old version of the file.** Make sure to use the latest `rls-policies.sql` from this commit.

---

### Error: "relation already exists"

This means the table/function was already created. Options:
1. Drop the existing object first: `DROP TABLE table_name CASCADE;`
2. Or modify the SQL to use `CREATE OR REPLACE` where applicable
3. Or start fresh by dropping all objects

---

### Error: "syntax error at or near..."

Check that you copied the ENTIRE file content without truncation. SQL files must be executed completely.

---

## üß™ Test Deployment

After successful deployment, test the system:

### 1. Test User Registration

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/auth/register
```

Try creating a new user account. It should:
- Create a record in `auth.users` (Supabase Auth)
- Trigger any necessary hooks
- Allow login afterward

### 2. Test Authentication

```bash
# Visit http://localhost:3000/auth/login
```

Try logging in with the created user. It should:
- Authenticate successfully
- Redirect to homepage or dashboard
- Session should persist

### 3. Test RLS Policies

Create a test query in SQL Editor:
```sql
-- This should only return data for the current user's tenant
SELECT * FROM students WHERE tenant_id = public.get_user_tenant_id();
```

---

## üéØ Success Indicators

When deployment is successful, you should see:

1. **In Supabase Dashboard:**
   - 30+ tables in Table Editor
   - 60+ RLS policies in Authentication ‚Üí Policies
   - 20+ functions in Database ‚Üí Functions
   - No errors in SQL Editor

2. **In Application:**
   - User registration works
   - User login works
   - Session persists
   - Protected routes work

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Supabase logs in Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
2. Review error messages carefully
3. Ensure you're running SQL as the database owner (default)
4. Try executing files one section at a time
5. Use transactions for safe testing:
   ```sql
   BEGIN;
   -- your SQL here
   ROLLBACK; -- or COMMIT if successful
   ```
